Project: Google-Homepage  
Goal: Recreate the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS  
Difficult Parts: Understanding how to layout the webpage  
Learned: Basic CSS and HTML, Basics of CSS Grid  
Reflection: Since this was my first dive into creating something with HTML and CSS I was a bit concerned about how the webpage would turn out. My biggest struggle was figuring out how to layout the webpage. I got to the point where I decided to take a step back from the project and research the problem. I quickly discovered and learned about CSS Grid. Useing what I learned I was able to come back to the project and create a copy of the google homepage I was proud of.
